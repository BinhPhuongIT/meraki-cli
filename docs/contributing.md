This project is relatively new and has been created out of need.

If you have a feature you would like to see built into it, please open up an issue in Github and describe your desired feature.

Any accepted feature requests will be listed in the [Enhancement Requests and Known Bugs](https://github.com/PackeTsar/meraki-cli/issues/2){:target="_blank"} issue page.

If you find a need for a feature and you add it in yourself, or you fix a bug you found, please feel free to open up a merge request!

If neither of those options work for you, and you just want to support this project, you can buy me a coffee :grin:
